                        As well as WikiMed in English, you can download one or more WikiMed archives (called ZIM archives) in
                        other languages from the Kiwix website: see the instructions below. There are also two sister apps in
                        the Store: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/p/wikivoyage-by-kiwix/9n5sb90q4jbj" target="_blank">
                        Wikivoyage by Kiwix</a>, and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/p/kiwix-js/9p8slz4j979j"
                        target="_blank">Kiwix JS</a>. Wikivoyage is an offline travel guide, and with Kiwix JS,
                        you can have full offline Wikipedia, Wiktionary and many other sources.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Offline archives use the <a href="http://www.openzim.org//wiki/OpenZIM" target="_blank">OpenZIM format</a>,
                        but note that Kiwix family apps have only been tested extensively on Wikimedia archives (e.g., Wikipedia,
                        Wikivoyage, Wikimed, Wiktionary).
                    </p>
                    <h3>Adding WikiMed archives in other languages</h3>
                    <h4>Step 1: download some content</h4>
                    <p>
                        In the Configuration <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-wrench"></span> menu, go to 
                        <a href="#packagedAppFileSelectors" onclick="$('#btnConfigure').click();"><b>Expert settings</b></a>
                        and check the option to <b>Display selectors</b>. Then check <b>Allow Internet access</b> and tap the
                        <b>Open library</b> button. Locate your WikiMed ZIM file, and instructions will be provided to download
                        the file on your device.
                        Alternatively, visit <a href="http://download.kiwix.org/zim" target="_blank">http://download.kiwix.org/zim/
                        </a> using a regular computer. <strong>This app is optimized for WikiMed archives only</strong>.
                        If you wish to use regularly other archive types with this app, you should instead obtain our sister app,
                        <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/p/kiwix-js/9p8slz4j979j" target="_blank">Kiwix JS</a> from the
                        Store and keep this as a dedicated WikiMed app.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Step 2: download or copy the content onto your device</h4>
                    <p>
                        If you have enough space, you can put several archives on your device storage. If you download the content
                        directly in the app, note the location of the saved file when you get the notification that it has
                        completed. If you downloaded via a PC, you will generally need to use a USB cable to copy the ZIM 
                        archive(s) to an accessible location on your device, such as the SD card or the main storage area if
                        there is enough space there. 
                    </p>
                    <h4>Step 3: open this app, go to the "Configure" menu and select your ZIM file</h4>
                    <p>
                        On the Configuration page, tap the "Select storage" button (you may need to <b>Display selectors</b> under
                        <b>Expert settings</b> if you didn't do this previously). If you have downloaded more than one archive, or
                        you have a split ZIM archive consisting of several 2GB files, then you will need to pick the <b>folder</b>
                        that contains these files. If you have just one unsplit ZIM archive, you can instead pick the <b>file</b>
                        direclty, using the respective buttons on the <a href="#" onclick="$('#btnConfigure').click();">
                        Configuration</a> page (note that these buttons only appear after you tap "Select Storage").
                    </p>
                    <h4>Step 4: enjoy your content offline!</h4>
                    <h3>Privacy policy</h3>
                    <h4>Short answer:</h4>
                    <p>
                        WikiMed Offline Medical Wikipedia works entirely offline unless you specifically request otherwise on the
                        Configuration page. We do not collect any of your personal data and don't even know what you are doing with
                        this application.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Longer answer:</h4>
                    <p>
                        WikiMed by Kiwix will only access the Kiwix download server if you specifically request it to find and
                        display download links for ZIM archives on the Configuration page. You can disable even this Internet
                        access with an option on the same page. If you nevertheless believe your Internet access can be watched
                        and/or if you are extremely cautious, you should shut down your 3G and WiFi access before using the
                        application.
                    </p>
                    <p>This application only reads the archive files of your device: it is not capable of reading any other
                    files.</p>
                    <p>
                        By default, this application will remember your last-visited page between sessions using a local cookie
                        that is accessible only by this app on this device. If you are accessing sensitive information that you do
                        not wish to be displayed next time you open this app, we recommend that you <a href="#privacy"
                        onclick="$('#btnConfigure').click();">turn this option off</a> in the Configuration options.
                    </p>

                    <p>This application is still a work in progress. There are many bugs that need fixing and improvements that
