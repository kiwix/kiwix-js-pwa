                    <ul>
                        <li>Workaround for mis-aligned toolbar icons on smaller screens</li>
                        <li>Fixed rogue HTML showing in some pages from recent ZIM archives</li>
                        <li>Better experience when scanning local storage for archives</li>

                    <h3>Please read this important information!</h3>
                    <p>
                        This application is packaged with the Wikivoyage offline ZIM archive.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You may download and use other ZIM archives (such as Wikipedia, Wiktionary, Wikimedicine) from the
                        <b>Configuration page <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-wrench"></span></b>, or else see the 
                        <b>About page <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-info-sign"></span></b> for more information.

                    <p>
                        We aim to keep this Wikivoyage as up to date as possible, and you should receive automatic updates via the Microsoft Store. Please note that if you 
                        donwload an updated version from the Configuration page<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-wrench"></span>, it will <b>not</b> update the packaged version
                        stored in this app, and you will use <b>double the amount of storage space space</b> on your device. This is a security feature of the OS, and we cannot
                        change it. We advise you to wait for an update from the Store.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Kiwix JS Wikivoyage is <b>free</b> and <b>open source</b>. If you like it, please leave a positive review. Constructive feedback and help with
                        improving the app are very welcome: see About section.

                    <p>
                        If your Internet access is expensive / slow / unreliable / watched / censored, you can still gain offline access to a huge
                        repository of knowledge and culture.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As well as Wikivoyage, you can download one or more archives (called ZIM archives) from the Kiwix website, enabling you to
                        read material from Wikipedia, Wiktionary and many other sources even if you are undertaking a long plane journey, hiking, 
                        and travelling or living in areas with weak Internet access.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You can search through article titles and read any of these articles completely offline.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You can have the entire content of Wiktionary or Wikipedia in your language (including the images) in your pocket.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Offline archives use the <a href="http://www.openzim.org//wiki/OpenZIM">OpenZIM format</a>, but note that this app has been only tested extensively on
                        Wikipedia-related archives (e.g., Wikipedia, Wikivoyage, Wikimed, Wiktionary
                    </p>
                    <h3>Usage</h3>
                    <h4>Step 1: download some content</h4>
                    <p>
                        You can browse the Kiwix repository on the <a href="#" onclick="$('#btnConfigure').click();">Configuration</a> page, and it will provide instructions according to the type of file you download.
                        Alternatively, visit <a href="http://download.kiwix.org/zim" target="_blank">http://download.kiwix.org/zim/</a> using a regular computer.
                        <strong>Currently only Wikimedia contents (ZIM files in wiki* subdirectories) have been tested fully</strong>.
                        There are known bugs when reading other contents; and audio/video/dynamic content is not currently supported.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Note that some of these ZIM archives are very large indeed (several gigabytes), especially if you want the archives with pictures. Archives without
                        pictures (look out for "nopic" in the filename) are generally much smaller. <b>Important</b>: if the file is larger than 4 GB, it might not be supported by
                        your device if your storage (e.g. microSD card) is formatted using a FAT filesystem. If so, it's possible to split the material into several 2GB files, or
                        to download pre-split files: see <a href="http://www.kiwix.org/wiki/FAQ">the Kiwix FAQ</a>.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Step 2: copy the content onto your device</h4>
                    <p>
                        If you have enough space, you can put several archives on your device storage. You will generally need to use a USB cable to copy the ZIM archive(s) to an
                        accessible location on your device, such as the SD card or the main storage area if there is enough space there.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Step 3: open this app, go to the "Configure" menu and select your ZIM file</h4>
                    <p>
                        If you have downloaded more than one archive, or you have a split ZIM archive consisting of several 2GB files, then you will need to pick the <b>folder</b>
                        that contains these files. If you have just one unsplit ZIM archive, you can instead pick the <b>file</b> direclty, using the respective buttons on the
                        <a href="#" onclick="$('#btnConfigure').click();">Configuration</a> page.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Step 4: enjoy Wikipedia offline!</h4>
                    <h3>Privacy policy</h3>
                    <h4>Short answer:</h4>
                    <p>
                        Kiwix JS Windows works entirely offline unless you specifically request otherwise on the Configuration page. We do not collect any of your personal data
                        and don't even know what you are doing with this application.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Longer answer:</h4>
                    <p>
                        Kiwix JS Windows will only access the Kiwix download server if you specifically request it to find and display download links for ZIM archives on the Configuration page.
                        You can disable even this Internet access with an option on the same page. If you nevertheless believe your Internet access can be watched and/or if you are
                        extremely cautious, you should shut down your 3G and WiFi access before using the application.
                    </p>
                    <p>This application only reads the archive files of your device: it is not capable of reading any other files.</p>
                    <h3>Feedback / helping / contributing</h3>
                    <p>This application is still a work in progress. There are many bugs that need fixing and improvements that need to be implemented. In particular:</p>
