# This is a utility script which helps developers choose sensible values for updating the online Docker-based implementation
# of this app while testing and developing code in a specific branch. It checks app.js and service-worker.js for consistency,
# and checks that that the underlying branch of a PR has been checked out (rather than the PR itself). It then calls the
# GitHub REST API for dispatching the workflow using the provided values.
#
# IMPORTANT: Ensure that your personal github token is in your local copy of the '/scripts' directory, saved as 'github_token'
#
# You may run this script with commandline switches -machine_name (this could be 'dev'), the -branch_name, and -dryrun (this
# will show the changes that would be made if run without the -dryrun switch). Alternatively, if you do not provide these
# values, you will be prompted with sensible defaults.
