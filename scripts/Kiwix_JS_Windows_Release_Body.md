To use this app, download your choice of free content in-app from the Download Library on the Configuration page. There is only a small **sample** archive provided in the UWP, Electron and NWJS versions (`<<zim>>`, <<date>>). For what's new, see the changes listed in the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/kiwix/kiwix-js-windows/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md). Builds are provided for 32bit and 64bit editions of Windows and Linux (tested on Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora and OpenSUSE).

**MS Store status: IN CERTIFICATION**
**Winget status: IN CERTIFICATION**

Please choose the correct version (those marked [**AUTO-UPDATE**] will self-update automatically when there is a new version):

* **Any modern OS (PWA)**
  + Try out our new **installable PWA** (Progressive Web App) simply by visiting https://pwa.kiwix.org/ [**AUTO-UPDATE**]. Incredibly light, no store or download required, no heavy framework! It works offline once the app has cached its code, and in Chrome/Edge/Chromium, you can install it right from within the app (in Firefox you can bookmark it). No sample archive is included.

* **Windows**:
  - **Store app for Windows 10/11 (UWP)**
    + Install from the Microsoft Store: https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9P8SLZ4J979J [**AUTO-UPDATE**] - *recommended*
    + Or, on a PC, open a Terminal (or command prompt) and run `winget install 'kiwix js' -s msstore` [**AUTO-UPDATE**]
    + Or, if you cannot use the Store, sideload a signed package with `winget install kiwix.kiwixjs` - this doesn't auto-update, but you can upgrade easily by running `winget upgrade kiwix.kiwixjs`
  - **Installable (Electron)**
    + Windows 7/8/10/11: [Kiwix-JS-Electron-Setup-<<numeric_tag>>-E.exe](https://github.com/kiwix/kiwix-js-windows/releases/download/v<<base_tag>>/Kiwix-JS-Electron-Setup-<<numeric_tag>>-E.exe) [**AUTO-UPDATE**]

## Installation Instructions - NWJS/Electron

* For the Windows Setup (installable) build, simply download and launch. It will install itself, together with a shortcut in your shortcut menu, and run. It auto-updates, but if you want to update it manually, then just install a new version over it (it will uninstall the old one for you).
* For the Windows Portable builds, the new executable version (ending `.exe`) can just be run, but it may be a bit slow to start up. For a faster experience, use one of the zipped versions: unzip the contents of either the Electron or the NWJS packages to any folder, or to a thumb drive, and double click on `Start Kiwix JS [Electron/Windows]` or `Start Kiwix JS [Windows/Electron].bat`.
* For the Linux portable builds, download and save the correct AppImage file anywhere (e.g. your Desktop), and double-click it. If it doesn’t work, open Terminal and run `chmod a+x Kiwix-JS-Electron*.AppImage` and then `./Kiwix-JS-Electron*.AppImage`. This version will auto-update. If you have issues running it on **Debian**, you can try adding the `--no-sandbox` switch to the command (see https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/17972#issuecomment-516957971). On older versions of **OpenSUSE**, you may need to use these commandline switches instead: `./Kiwix.JS.Electron*.AppImage --use-gl=disabled --disable-gpu-compositing`.¹
* For the Linux installable builds:
  + _Debian/Ubuntu_: download the correct `.deb` package. Open a terminal, `cd` to the directory containing the package, and type `sudo apt install ./kiwix-js-electron*.deb`. Once installed, on **Debian**, you may have to run the app by opening terminal and typing `kiwix-js-electron --no-sandbox`. On **Ubuntu**, you should be able to run it from its installed icon. When you want to update, just install the new version, and it will install over the old version.
  + _Fedora_: download the correct `.rpm` package. You should be able to install it by opening the File manager, locating the package, and double-clicking it. Alternatively, open a terminal and `cd` to the directory with the package, and then type `sudo rpm --install ./kiwix-js-electron-*.rpm` (you may need to do `chmod a+x kiwix-js-electron-*.rpm` first). After install, you should find Kiwix JS Electron in you app list, and you can launch it from there, or type `kiwix-js-electron` in a terminal.
  + _OpenSUSE_: download the correct `.rpm` package. You probably won't be able to install this with the File manager due to a dependency issue. Instead, open a Terminal with superuser privileges, navigate to the directory containing the `.rpm` package, and type `zypper install  kiwix-js-electron-*.rpm` (you may need to do `chmod a+x kiwix-js-electron-*.rpm` first). You may be informed about missing dependencies: choose "Solution 2: break kiwix-js-electron... by ignoring some of its dependencies'. You will also be warned that the app is not signed. You can ignore this, if you trust this repository. If the app refuses to run due to dependencies, try installing Chrome or another Chromium browser, then re-run the app. On older versions of OpenSUSE, when you run the app, you may need to add the commandline switches `--use-gl=disabled --disable-gpu-compositing`, but this appears to be resolved recently.¹
* Windows (zipped apps): If you get a Windows Smartscreen notification on first launch of the zipped portable apps, follow instructions to "Run anyway" if you trust this site. If you prefer, use one of the executable versions (ending `.exe`) which are digitally signed.

¹ With many thanks to Jay Midura for documenting the switches needed for OpenSUSE.

## Release Notes

* In order to minimize download size, the sample archive (where provided) has no images in articles apart from the landing page, and only the lede (summary) of each article is included. The packaged archive is located in the `archives` folder (where this is accessible). See the readme in that folder for more information.
* You can download many different archives in multiple languages from the Configuration page.
* There is experimental support for reading Zimit archives, most of which require you to enable Service Worker mode to read most content (this is not available in older browsers or OSs).
* The app supports dark mode for Wikimedia, Gutenberg and Stackexchange ZIMs, but not for Zimit archives unless the archive provides its own dark mode.
* You can print by pressing Ctrl-P or using the print icon. If local printers are not available (after clicking on More options...) then print to PDF and use another app to print.
* You can open a new browsable window by right-clicking, middle-clicking or ctrl-clicking an article link (not available in every mode, see option in Configuration).
* You can open the ZIM's article index by typing a space in the search box. Sometimes you may need to search the URL index instead: to open this, type **_space /_** (a space followed by a forward slash) in the search box. In older ZIMs, you will find articles under the `A/` namespace and images under the `I/` namespace, but in newer ZIMs almost all content is under the `C/` namesapce.
* In title search, you can use wildcards `.*` or `.+` (this works best if you start the search with a normal alphanumeric string). You can include a more complex regular expression by enclosing it within `(?:my_regular_expression)`. See Configuration -> About for more details and limitations.
* You can search for any file in a ZIM by prefixing the namespace, e.g. `C/isaac.*newton.*webp` in recent ZIMs where all content is in the `C` namespace, or `I/isaac.*newton` in older ZIMs where images are in the `I` namespace and articles in the `A` namespace.

### Known Issues

* INCONSISTENCY: When printing in jQuery mode, all sections are opened before printing (if the user had closed any), whereas in SW mode, closed sections are not opened before printing, if they were closed.
* On the XP build with some recent ZIMs __there is a CSS error in rendering the landing page of this ZIM__, due to the age of the Chromium build included in the runtime package. However, you can access all articles by __pressing a space in the search box__.
* In the Electron and NWJS apps, if you download an archive from within the app (from Configuration), you will be able to pick a download directory, and the download will start, but then there will be no further indication that a download is in progress. You will need to check the chosen download directory to see if the download has completed.
* The NWJS app for Windows 7/8/10/11 will occasionally crash and exit when running in ServiceWorker mode. For now, it is recommended to use this app only in JQuery mode until this issue is resolved.
* In the NWJS app only, YouTube-based videos in **Zimit archives** do not play with sound (this does not affect other archives such as TED Talks or Khan Academy).
* Image manipulation (e.g. saving image to disk) does not currently work with the NWJS app.
* Please see https://github.com/kiwix/kiwix-js-windows/issues for further known issues. If you find a new issue, please open a new issue on that page.
