# Installing the Kiwix JS PWA

In Chromium browsers (e.g. Chrome or Edge), you can install the PWA as an offline-first app. It will have its own icon and will show up in the All Apps list (e.g. in Windows), or will have a desktop launcher (in Linux). Firefox doesn't support installing PWAs, but instead you can bookmark it and (after your first visit) it will work offline when you open the bookmark.

Installing in a Chromium browser also has the advantage that the app can then handle ZIM archives that you launch from the file system (e.g. by double-clicking the archive in File Explorer).
