# How to add Kiwix JS PWA to the Edge sidebar

This is a new feature of the Microsoft Edge browser. Simply enable the sidebar in Settings, then go to https://pwa.kiwix.org, click the plus sign in the sidebar, then "Add current page".
You may need to adjust the width of the bar so that all the icons fit. You can also reduce the size of the UI in Configuration if you'd like a snugger fit. Please note that the current
icon is white, which means it is more visible if the Edge theme is set to "Dark". We are looking into adding an outline to the favicon that is used to make it more visible in light mode.
