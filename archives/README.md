Due to GitHub filesize restrictions, it is not possible to upload ZIMs that are larger than 100Mb to this directory. If you wish to build the source code yourself, you will need to add
the appropriate packaged ZIM file to your local repository before building. The *.zim.txt file in this directory gives the current expected ZIM archive, though note that it should be
given a generic name in the app to ensure updates happen smoothly. See init.js for the
expected generic name (e.g. wikivoyage_en.zim).
