* UPDATE: January 2018 update of Wikivoyage ZIM archive to wikivoyage_en_all_novid_2018-01.zim
* ENHANCEMENT: The Wikivoyage app now hides the file selectors by default in the Config menu to avoid confusion and to encourage use of Kiwix JS for anything not related to Wikivoyage
* FIX: Added icon indicating that a link is to an external web site
* ENHANCEMENT: Inject footnote backlinks if the ZIM doesn't have any
* ENHANCEMENT: Support ZIMs that have subdirectories (Stackexchange family ZIMs)
* FIX: Bugs in mobile to desktop style transformation
* FIX: Issue with infoboxes and images not stacking correctly on mobile displays
* FIX: Support new-style infoboxes in German Wikivoyage
* FIX: Last-visited page was not being remembered when user picked the file as a single archive
* FIX: Bug which prevented the dark mode by simple inversion from functioning
* FIX: Issue with toolbar icons being misaligned on small screens

## Release 0.9.6 (beta)

* FIX: Prevent bottom toolbar from wrapping across two lines on small screens
* ENHANCEMENT: Enabled autoloading of last-read page on app start (and privacy option to turn this off)
* ENHANCEMENT: Geo-location co-ordinates in English and German Wikivoyage are represented with a location marker that links to the Maps app (opens map to show the precise location)
* ENHANCEMENT: Telephone numbers marked with tel: links will attempt to open a relevant app for dialling (e.g., Skype or the People app) when selected
* FIX: Links in Stackexchange ZIMs are now recognized and can be used to open the content
* WORKAROUND: Some Wikivoyage entries have HTML showing in the header, and this is now (temporarily) suppressed (the HTML is interpreted) until the ZIMs are fixed
* ENHANCEMENT: The toolbar icon now switches to a Wikivoyage logo if a Wikivoyage ZIM is loaded

## Release 0.9.3 (beta)

* WORKAROUND: Mis-aligned toolbar icons on smaller screens
* FIX: Rogue HTML showing in some pages from recent ZIM archives
* ENHANCEMENT: Better experience when scanning local storage for archives

## Release 0.9.0 (beta)

* ENHANCEMENT: Auto-loading of ZIM archives on device storage
* ENHANCEMENT: In-page search / highlighting with Ctrl-F / Alt-F or tap on search button
* ENHANCEMENT: Uses UWP APIs for sotrage: Future Access List so that users do not need to pick their ZIM file every time
* ENHANCEMENT: Dark-themed User Interface
* ENHANCEMENT: Experimental Wikipedia Dark Theme
* ENHANCEMENT: Font scaling for articles and for the UI
* ENHANCEMENT: Cleaner, minimalistic UI (eliminated hamburger menu due to poor navigability)
* FIX: Display of SVG files is handled by careful queuing of images to send to the decompressor (fixes hang in articles with many equations)
* ENHANCEMENT: If the TeX string of an equation is available, it will be typeset using MathJax (huge speed improvement)
* ENHANCEMENT: Transform the layout of Wikipedia articles from desktop to mobile style and vice versa (experimental)
* ENHANCEMENT: Disable the display of images, and extract them one-by-one as needed (for slow devices)
* ENHANCEMENT: Only send images in current viewport to the decompressor, and prefetch configurable (by developer) number of images from above and below the viewport
